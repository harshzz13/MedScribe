🔹 Project Overview

A system that takes long, unstructured medical reports (like discharge summaries) and generates short, readable summaries for patients/doctors.

Doctors: get quick insights from lengthy case notes.

Patients: receive simplified reports in plain language.

🔹 Tech Stack

1. Core AI/NLP

Hugging Face Transformers → Pretrained models for summarization.

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) → great for abstractive summarization.

BART → another strong choice for text summarization tasks.

2. Backend

Python (FastAPI or Flask) → to serve the summarization model as an API.

3. Frontend / UI

Streamlit / Gradio (quickest way to demo an NLP model with a nice UI).

Optional: React.js for a more polished full-stack app.

4. Dataset

MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) → open-access dataset with discharge summaries.

You can preprocess a subset for training/fine-tuning.

5. Deployment (Optional)

Docker → containerize model + backend.

Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces → deploy for free.

Google Cloud / AWS → for production deployment.

🔹 Project Flow (Step-by-Step)

Step 1: Data Preparation

Collect reports from MIMIC-III (or other medical datasets).

Clean data → remove PHI (personal health identifiers), normalize medical terms.

Split into long text (input) and short discharge summary (target).

Step 2: Model Selection & Fine-tuning

Load T5 / BART from Hugging Face.

Fine-tune on medical dataset → train model to map long reports → short summaries.

Save fine-tuned weights.

Step 3: Inference Pipeline

User uploads report (TXT/PDF).

Preprocess: convert into plain text, chunk if too long.

Model generates summary (2–5 sentences).

Step 4: Build API

Wrap model in FastAPI/Flask → /summarize endpoint.

Accepts text → returns summarized report.

Step 5: User Interface

Streamlit App →

File upload (PDF/TXT).

Show original text (scrollable).

Show summarized text (highlighted).

Step 6: Deployment

Push model + API + UI to Hugging Face Spaces (simple) or Dockerize & deploy on GCP/AWS.

🔹 Example Workflow (User Side)

Doctor uploads patient discharge summary (3 pages).

Model processes text → extracts and rewrites main findings.

Output:

Condensed Summary (for doctor): “65-year-old male admitted for chest pain, diagnosed with myocardial infarction, discharged after stent placement. Prescribed aspirin, beta-blockers.”

Simplified Summary (for patient): “You had a heart attack, doctors placed a stent, and you’ve been discharged with medicines to prevent future problems.”
